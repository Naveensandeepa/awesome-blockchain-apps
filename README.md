### Centralized Exchanges
Centralized exchanges (CEXs) are organizations that coordinate cryptocurrency trading on a large scale, using a similar business model to traditional asset exchanges like stock exchanges.
Exchanges are essentially marketplaces. They are useful when a large number of people may be simultaneously trying to buy and sell the same type of asset. In the traditional economy, famous exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange and the London Metal Exchange.

### Decentralize Exchanges
Decentralized crypto exchanges (DEXs) are blockchain-based apps that coordinate large-scale trading of crypto assets between many users. They do that entirely through automated algorithms, instead of the conventional approach of acting as financial intermediary between buyers and sellers.
The algorithms that DEXs use are examples of smart contracts. They are pieces of code written on top of blockchain networks like Ethereum that trigger various outputs when given certain inputs.
The idea behind a DEX is "disintermediation," which means removing middlemen to allow regular people to do business directly with each another. A DEX doesn't offer custody of users’ crypto assets. Instead, users directly hold all their assets in their own wallets at all times. [from](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-dex-how-decentralized-crypto-exchanges-work/)

### Initial DEX Offering
An initial DEX offering, or IDO, is a new and exciting type of decentralized and permissionless crowdfunding platform, which is opening up a new way of fundraising in the crypto space. 
If a project is launching an IDO, it means the project is launching a coin or token via a decentralized liquidity exchange. This is a type of crypto asset exchange that depends on liquidity pools where traders can swap tokens, including crypto coins and stablecoins. For instance, USDT/ETH is a liquidity pair.

###  NFT Market Spaces
An NFT marketplace is a digital platform for buying and selling NFTs. These platforms allow people to store and display their NFTs plus sell them to others for cryptocurrency or money. Some NFT marketplaces also allow users to mint their NFTs on the platform itself. [from](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-nft-marketplaces/)

###  Decentralized Autonomous Organization
A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity with no central leadership. Decisions get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain.
